# Builder Pattern
1. Some objects are simple while some are not
2. Hence these complex objects are difficult to be intialized in a single call
3. Having an initializer with 10 arguments is not a good way
4. Hence we can opt for 'piecewise construction'
5. Builder provides an API for constructing the object step-by-step
