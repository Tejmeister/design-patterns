#SOLID Principles:

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
1. Also known as separation of concerns
2. A class should have single responsibilty
3. Eg. A journal class and a diary class should not have their independent persistence functions in their class if they basically
do the same operation
The persistence methods can be moved to a separate class say PersistenceManager so that you can edit the method if required at one
central level

## Open-Closed Principle
1. Open for extension, closed for modification
2. Once Classes are defined at design time there should not be modifications done in them at later point
If needed extend the base classes and create more concrete classes

The old type of implementation (a separate method for each filter type) can cause 'State Space Explosion'
For example,
we have 2 criteria, then then are at least 3 methods needed to filter properly
if we have 3 criteria, then minimum methods with only 'and' operation will be 7
